# F1 Prediction Application

This application predicts the standings of each race for the 2025 Formula 1 season, including driver and constructor championship points, using historical data and machine learning models.

---

## Features

1. **Race Standings Prediction**: Predicts the finishing positions of drivers for each race.
2. **Driver and Constructor Analysis**: Provides insights into driver and team performance.
3. **Historical Trends**: Analyzes historical data to identify patterns and trends.
4. **Live Updates**: Offers real-time updates and predictions during the season.

  - Function: Serves APIs for fetching predictions, managing user queries, and delivering data to the frontend.
- **Prediction Service**:
  - Framework: **Python** with **Flask** or **FastAPI**.
  - Function: Handles prediction tasks using pre-trained ML models.
- **Database**:
  - **PostgreSQL**: For storing structured historical and prediction data.
  - **Redis**: (Optional) In-memory caching for frequently accessed results.

#### **ML Pipeline**
- Frameworks: **TensorFlow**, **PyTorch**, or **Scikit-learn**.
- Deployment: Package models using **ONNX** or deploy via **AWS SageMaker**, **Google AI Platform**, or **Docker containers**.

#### **Serverless Functions**
- **AWS Lambda** or **Google Cloud Functions** for lightweight tasks such as fetching live race data or triggering model updates.

#### **Monitoring and Logging**
- Tools: **Prometheus** and **Grafana** for system metrics; **ELK Stack** or **AWS CloudWatch** for logs.

## Key Development Steps

### 1. Data Collection
- Gather historical race data, including results, qualifying times, weather, circuit characteristics, and team and driver stats.
- Sources: [Kaggle F1 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/formula-1-world-championship-1950-2020), [Pitwall](https://pitwall.app/).

### 2. Feature Engineering
- Metrics: Driver/team performance, circuit-specific factors, temporal performance trends.

### 3. Model Development
- Algorithms: Regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, SVR) and classification models (e.g., Random Forests, Gradient Boosting).
- Techniques: Ensemble methods for improved accuracy.

### 4. Model Deployment
- Serve models using **FastAPI** or **Flask**.
- Deploy on **AWS SageMaker**, **Google AI Platform**, or **Docker containers**.

### 5. Continuous Improvement
- Update the model with race-by-race data during the 2025 season.
- Employ adaptive learning for refining predictions based on new trends.
