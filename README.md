- **Backend:** FastAPI or Flask (for serving APIs)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (for storing historical race data and predictions)
- **ML Pipeline:** Scikit-learn or TensorFlow (for building and serving machine learning models)
- **Containerization:** Docker (for easy deployment)

## Features

- Predict the Driver and Constructor Championship winners based on past performance.
- Display race-by-race points prediction for drivers and teams.
- Interactive user interface to visualize predictions.
