Predict Qualifying Position

    Train a separate model for qualifying position using relevant features like q1, q2, q3 lap times, grid position, and track characteristics.
    Use this prediction as input for the race prediction model.

Carry Over Points for Championship Standings

    Maintain a cumulative points table that updates after each predicted race.
    Fetch previous race results of each driver and sum up their points before making a prediction.

Filter Teams for a Specific Season

    Create an endpoint to fetch constructors (teams) that participated in the current season.
    Ensure predictions consider only drivers from the filtered teams.

Remove Circuits endpoint
    No use for it if there is a race endpoint that fetches all of the races in order for an inputed year
