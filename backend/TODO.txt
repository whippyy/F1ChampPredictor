Predict Qualifying Position

    Train a separate model for qualifying position using relevant features like q1, q2, q3 lap times, grid position, and track characteristics.
    Use this prediction as input for the race prediction model.

    Currently using the same model that was use to predict the sunday races. 
    Currently not working right now. Might have to look into training its own model to be inputed into prediction model to keep it separate.


//^^^
Qual prdictions are now made with the same model for easier usage, prdictions now work, need to pull info on the drivers on who the id corresponds to

Carry Over Points for Championship Standings

    Maintain a cumulative points table that updates after each predicted race.
    Fetch previous race results of each driver and sum up their points before making a prediction.

Filter Teams for a Specific Season (Done)

    Create an endpoint to fetch constructors (teams) that participated in the current season.
    Ensure predictions consider only drivers from the filtered teams.

Remove Circuits endpoint
    No use for it if there is a race endpoint that fetches all of the races in order for an inputed year

Retrain model to take in all of the data

Issues:
    predictions are all the same order across races
    ^ still the same
